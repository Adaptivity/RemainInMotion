*-*-* THINGS THAT ARE BUGS THAT WILL DEFINITELY BE FIXED *-*-*

*-*-* THINGS THAT ARE FLAWS THAT WILL HOPEFULLY BE FIXED AT SOME POINT *-*-*

Anything that already uses a display list to render will not properly render in-transit.

When translocated, some entities (especially chest-carts) behave strangely, but nothing major (so far).

*-*-* THINGS THAT ARE NOT BUGS BUT HOPEFULLY WILL EVENTUALLY BE FIXED *-*-*

Portal spawners from iChun's "Portal Gun" mod do not yet work on carriages. Try finding some way (possibly using additional mods) to activate a portal gun directly instead.

"Billund" blocks have been reported to be wonky when moved by carriages.

Anything else that caches 'x/y/z' values for any reason (possibly some chunkloaders, likely anything that does teleportation) has a strong chance of misbehaving. These should be reported to me as bugs.

*-*-* THINGS THAT ARE NOT BUGS THAT PROBABLY WILL NEVER BE FIXED *-*-*

If you are using Optifine and get an error with the word "ConnectedTextures" in it, either disable connected textures in Optifine or disable/remove Optifine.

ComputerCraft programs that are carried by carriages and interact with the carriage's drive, need to have a delay added to their "startup" program to give time for things to settle before trying to interact again. Try "os.sleep(0.1)", and increase that number if it still doesn't work. (The more overloaded your machine or Minecraft is at the time, or the more computers or turtles you have on the same carriage, the higher this number will need to be. Making the number higher than it needs to be is fine: Too much won't hurt, but too little will.)

Computers on carriages that are running at the time of motion will reboot after motion, and run their 'startup' program. (Computers that are off at the time of motion will remain off.)

If a carriage is moving continuously, and the continuous-mode delay is set to 0, tile entities (like chests) will not render properly after the first motion until the carriage stops. This is purely cosmetic, and does no harm. To prevent this, make sure the continuous-mode delay is greater than zero. (The more Minecraft, your system, or the server is overloaded, or the longer delay there is between you and the server, the higher this number will need to be.)
