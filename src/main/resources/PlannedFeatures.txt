*-*-* THINGS HIGH ON THE PRIORITY LIST *-*-*

Redoing translocator labels and other things to use a GUI instead of trying to draw on the block.

An optional "hardcore" mode involving tiered crafting and power consumption, for people who want this mod to be expensive to use.

*_*_* THINGS TO BE WORKED ON LATER *-*-*

The ability to prevent individual blocks/items from being registered.

A config option to let a carriage treat blacklisted blocks as simple obstructions instead of completely aborting the motion.

The ability to selectively whitelist/blacklist blocks in-game for each drive, in addition to the overall config-file blacklist. These blocks will always be treated as simple obstructions instead of completely aborting the motion, regardless of the setting in the config file.

A form of "sticky carpeting" to allow finer control over where on a carriage entities are grabbed.

Different styles of controlling player position during carriage movement, to try to allow more freedom.
